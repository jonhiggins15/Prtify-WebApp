# Prtify-WebApp
<i>Let everyone have a say in what to play!</i>


<h2>About</h2>
Prtify is a democratic queue for Spotify, where everyone can upvote and downvote songs to determine what plays next.  If everyone is 
excited about a song, they can upvote it to the top of the queue, and it will play before the less popular songs.  Prtify also
uses Spotify's connected devices, so it can play on Playstations, Desktops, Amazon Echos, and other devices with Spotify. 


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To use Prtify, the person who wants to start the party needs to download the Android app on the Play Store and sign in with Spotify.
Next, they need to create a party and tell the party name to their friends.  Once the friends know the party name, they can go
to prtify.com and join the party.  Now, everyone can find and add music to the queue, and listen to the songs they want.
